# Phishing Detection with Machine Learning
A simple Python project to detect phishing emails using NLP and Naive Bayes.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python phishing_detection.py`

## Dataset
Uses a sample dataset. For production, use a larger dataset like Enron or Kaggle's phishing email datasets.

## Future Improvements
- Use a larger dataset.
- Experiment with advanced models like BERT or LSTM.
- Add a web interface for user input.
